Q1. 	Agile vs DevOps

A.	Agile is the methodology of breaking the development process into small deliverables. Each 	
	deliverable has 3 phases:

	1. development
	2. testing
	3. delivery
	
	The if there needs to be more iterations, then after delivering the software, development of 		next phase starts. This iterations is continues until the software is completed.

	Whereas in DevOps, continues integration takes place. once the phase is completed and 
	deployed to production, DevOps makes sure that the production envirnoment keeps working 
	there is as few downtime as possible. This phase of maintaining the production is not 
	supported by Agile.

Q2.	Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment
A. 	CI: Continus Integration is automatic process of building and testing the project.
	Continuous Delivery: Is the automatic process which keeps software ready for business
	Continuous Deployment:  Every change hat have passed the CI and CD can then be release 
	customers.

Q3. 	What are the benefits of Cloud Computing.
A.	1. Pay only until resourses are being used
	2. scalable resourses (can scale up and scale down as per requirement)
	3. no need to buy dedicated resourses

Q4. 	Difference b/w Git & Github
A		GIT					GITHUB
	1. It is a set of commands		| this is a server
	2. Git resides are local machine	| It is cloud based hosting service
	3. It controls the versioning of code	| this saves all the repositories.
