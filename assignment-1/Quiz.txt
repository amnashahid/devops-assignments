Q1. 	Agile vs DevOps

A.	Agile is the methodology of breaking the development process into small deliverables. Each 	
	deliverable has 3 phases:

	1. development
	2. testing
	3. delivery
	
	The if there needs to be more iterations, then after delivering the software, development of 	next phase starts. This iterations is continues until the software is completed.

	Whereas in DevOps, continues integration takes place. once the phase is completed and 
	deployed to production, DevOps makes sure that the production envirnoment keeps working 
	there is as few downtime as possible. This phase of maintaining the production is not 
	supported by Agile.
